Part One
Before doing this part, read the handout entitled SimpleMachine.
In the SimpleMachine handout, the instructions for the Simple Machine were detailed, as well as the
specification for our register transfer language (rtl). 
Part of the algorithm necessary for simulating (or microprogramming) the operation of our Simple Machine using rtl was also provided. 

In this part, you willfinish this algorithm by: 
	
	adding the clauses necessary for each of the missing instructions. 
	
	You should refer to the handout SimpleMachineDatapaths for details on which registers can be transferred to which
	other registers and in what directions (although you should only have to use this for checking your work).

	Also remember that each instruction cycle is limited to a single instruction memory cycle and a single
	data memory cycle.

	Hand in a listing of your pseudocode using rtl, with sufficient documentation (using standard C or C++-
	style comments) to indicate which instructions are which. Place the code to process the instructions in
	the instructions' numeric order so that it is easy to follow. 
	(i.e., the code for HALT first, then for LOAD, etc.)

	You can check your work by looking at the code for the real simulator. See the file sim/simulate.c.
	(You will also have to refer to the sim.h and inst.h header files in the sim directory.)
