Part Two
Before doing this part, you should experiment with the provided test programs for the sim simulator.
You should also implement the sample programs described in Exercises-SimpleMachine.
After implementing the three programs in the exercises you should see that there are some kinds of
things that easy to program on the Simple Machine and some that are quite difficult. In this part you will
continue with those experiments.
Write a sim program to implement the following problem:
Given a variable largest, an array of numbers (array), and the number of elements in the
array(N), write a program to find the largest number in the array and place it in largest.
Your solution should, of course, work for any size array of (positive or negative) numbers. I suggest that
you use numbers that are not too large (positive or negative), say, less than 10000 decimal (0x2700). 
You may use (in fact, you will need) temporary variables to implement this program.
A suggested algorithm may be found as asmt01/largest.skel. Feel free to use it, to design your
own algorithm, or something in-between.
Hand in a paper copy of your Simple Machine program, annotated with labels, mnemonic instructions
and comments so that it is easy to follow. The program header should contain a short description of the
problem. (See the sample programs in the tests directory of sim as examples of annotations.)
Transfer a copy of your program as a plain text file on hills using the procedure discussed in
AssignmentGuidelines. The name of the program must be largest (note: there is no extension!)
