Part Three
In this part you will simply do some problems. You must show your work to get credit. Submit them
with the rest of the assignment. From Chapter 1 of the text:
• Problem 1.2.1. For each computer a and b in the table, assume both configurations are
allowed and your framebuffer must accommodate both. What is the minimum amount of RAM
required for two framebuffers sufficient in size to store a frame using 24-bit color (8 bits for each pixel). 
(Two framebuffers are often used so that one buffer can be filled while the other is
displaying.)
• Problem 1.3.1 for the b. set. Do the problem for all processors in the set.
• Problem 1.4.2 for the b. set. Use the program information in problem 1.4.1
• Problems 1.6.4, 1.6.5 and 1.6.6 for the b. set.
• Problems 1.11.1 - 1.11.3 for the b set
For the integer representation section, do this problem: You are given a signed 16-bit integer whose
value is 32140 in base 5. What is its decimal, hexadecimal and binary value? What is its value in
hexadecimal if the integer is converted to a 32-bit integer? Remember to show your work.
